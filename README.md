Multi-User Blog
===============

## Description
A multi-user blog created using Google App Engine. Users can sign-up to create an account, then create, edit, or delete their posts. Other users' posts can be 'liked', or 'unliked', and comments can be posted and edited. Non-users can still view posts, but are not able to 'like' them, or leave comments.

## Usage
To run the app, you can download the files, or clone the repository, and run `dev_appserver.py .` in the terminal. Alternatively, a live version of the blog can be found [here](https://multi-user-blog-165915.appspot.com).
